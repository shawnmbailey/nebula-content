   <p><strong>Originally released in 1989, the Air Jordan 4 instantly peaked the imaginations of basketball fans everywhere!</strong></p> 
   <p><b><i>From a design aspect the 4s carried over some flavors from the Air Jordan 3 while infusing newer elements. Both pairs featured similar toe box overlays, heel tabs and tooling (midsole + outsole) but that’s where the likenesses end. Nike loaded more Air Max tech into the 4’s midsole, add plastic lockdown “wings” and breathable mesh-backed cutouts. The wings and cutouts are distant relatives of future Nike technologies in the form of Flywire and Hyperfuse.</i></b></p>
   <p><strong> Now Nike and Jordan brands are bringing back a fan favorite just in time for summer fashion!</strong></p>
